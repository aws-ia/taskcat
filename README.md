# taskcat

---
##Caution!
> This repo is NOT the stable version of taskcat, that is here: https://github.com/aws-quickstart/taskcat. If you are involved in developing the next taskcat version, 
or want the bleeding edge then this repo is what you seek.

## Install

Can be installed side-by-side with stable taskcat, as it has a different package name and binary (`taskcat-v9`).

recommend using pyenv and/or virtualenv to ensure you're installing into a clean environment

```bash
git clone git@github.com:taskcat/taskcat-v9.git
cd taskcat-v9
pip3 install -e .
```
