It deploys your AWS CloudFormation template in multiple AWS Regions and generates a report with a pass/fail grade for each region. You can specify the regions and number of Availability Zones you want to include in the test, and pass in parameter values from your AWS CloudFormation template. taskcat is implemented as a Python class that you import, instantiate, and run. taskcat was developed by the aws-ia team to test AWS CloudFormation templates that automatically deploy workloads on AWS. We\u2019re pleased to make the tool available to all developers who want to validate their custom AWS CloudFormation templates across AWS Regions Support Installation Currently only installation via pip is supported. Installation via docker coming soon. Requirements The host taskcat is run on requires access to an AWS account, this can be done by any of the following mechanisms: Environment variables Shared credential file (~/.aws/credentials) AWS config file (~/.aws/config) Assume Role provider Boto2 config file (/etc/boto.cfg and ~/.boto) Instance metadata service on an Amazon EC2 instance that has an IAM role configured. for more info see the boto3 credential configuration documentation . Note: docker is only required if building lambda functions using a Dockerfile Installing via pip3 pip3 install taskcat Installing via pip3 --user will install taskcat into homedir, useful if you get permissions errors with the regular method pip3 install taskcat --user Note: the user install dir is platform specific For Example: (On Mac: ~/Library/Python/3.x/bin/taskcat) For Example: (On Linux: ~/.local/bin) Warning: Be sure to add the python bin dir to your $PATH Windows taskcat on Windows is not supported . If you are running Windows 10 we recommend that you install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and then install taskcat inside the WSL environment using the steps above. Usage CLI The cli is self documenting by using --help . The most common use of taskcat is for executing function tests of CloudFormation templates. The command for this is: taskcat test run add --help to see the supported flags and arguments Python Taskcat can be imported into Python and used in the testing framework of your choice. from taskcat.testing import CFNTest test = CFNTest . from_file ( project_root = './template_dir' ) with test as stacks : # Calling 'with' or 'test.run()' will deploy the stacks. for stack in stacks : print ( f \"Testing { stack . name } \" ) bucket_name = \"\" for output in stack . outputs : if output . key == \"LogsBucketName\" : bucket_name = output . value break assert \"logs\" in bucket_name assert stack . region . name in bucket_name print ( f \"Created bucket: { bucket_name } \" ) The example used here is very simple, you would most likely leverage other python modules like boto3 to do more advanced testing. The CFNTest object can be passed the same arguments as taskcat test run . See the docs for more details. Config files taskcat has several configuration files which can be used to set behaviors in a flexible way. Global config ~/.taskcat.yml provides global settings that become defaults for all projects. # General configuration settings general auth # AWS authentication section < AUTH_NAME > parameters : # Parameter key-values to pass to cfn (global parameters take precedence) < PARAMETER_NAME > s3_bucket : # Name of S3 bucket to upload project to (if left out a bucket will be auto-generated) s3_regional_buckets : # Boolean flag to upload the project to a bucket (generated in each region specified) tags : # Tags to apply to CloudFormation template TAG_NAME Project config File location: /.taskcat.yml` provides project specific configuration. project # Project specific configuration section auth # AWS authentication section < AUTH_NAME > az_blacklist # List of Availability Zones ID's to exclude when generating availability zones build_submodules # Build Lambda zips recursively for submodules, set to false to disable lambda_source_path # Path relative to the project root containing Lambda zip files, default is 'lambda_functions/source' lambda_zip_path # Path relative to the project root to place Lambda zip files, default is 'lambda_functions/zips' name # Project name, used as s3 key prefix when uploading objects owner # Email address for project owner (not used at present) package_lambda # Package Lambda functions into zips before uploading to s3, set to false to disable parameters # Parameter key-values to pass to CloudFormation, parameters provided in global config take precedence < PARAMETER_NAME > regions # List of AWS regions s3_bucket # Name of S3 bucket to upload project to, if left out a bucket will be auto-generated s3_enable_sig_v2 # Enable (deprecated) sigv2 access to auto-generated buckets s3_object_acl # ACL for uploaded s3 objects, defaults to 'private' tags # Tags to apply to CloudFormation template < TAG_NAME > template # path to template file relative to the project config file path tests : auth # AWS authentication section < AUTH_NAME > az_blacklist # List of Availability Zones ID's to exclude when generating availability zones parameters # Parameter key-values to pass to CloudFormation, parameters provided in global config take precedence < PARAMETER_NAME > regions # List of AWS regions s3_bucket # Name of S3 bucket to upload project to, if left out a bucket will be auto-generated tags # Tags to apply to CloudFormation template < TAG_NAME > template # Path to template file relative to the project config file path > At minimum it must provide a project name , list of regions , template name and one test . Minimal example : ``` yaml project : name : my - cfn - project regions : - us - west - 2 - eu - north - 1 tests : default : template : ./ templates / my - template . yaml Complete example with comments: tests/data/config_full_example/.taskcat.yml Parameter overrides a parameter override file can be created in <PROJECT_ROOT>/.taskcat_overrides.yml . Parameter Keys/Values specified in this file take precedence over values defined in all other configuration files. For example: KeyPair : my-overriden-keypair VpcId : vpc-1234abcd Warning: it is recommended to add .taskcat_overrides.yml to .gitignore to ensure it is not accidentally checked into source control Precedence With the exception of the parameters section, more specific config with the same key takes precedence. The rationale behind having parameters function this way is so that values can be overridden at a system level outside of a project, that is likely committed to source control. parameters that define account specific things like VPC details, Key Pairs, or secrets like API keys can be defined per host outside of source control. For example, consider this global config: ~/.taskcat.yml general : s3_bucket : my-globally-defined-bucket parameters : KeyPair : my-global-ec2-keypair Given a simple project config: project : name : my-project regions : - us-east-2 tests : default : template : ./template.yaml The effective test configuration would become: tests : default : template : ./template.yaml s3_bucket : my-globally-defined-bucket parameters : KeyPair : my-global-ec2-keypair If any item is re-defined in a project it takes precedence over the global value. Anything defined in a test takes precedence over what is defined in the project or global configuration. with the exception of the parameters section which works in reverse. For example, using the same global config as above, given this project config: project : name : my-project regions : - us-east-2 s3_bucket : my-project-s3-bucket tests : default : template : ./template.yaml parameters : KeyPair : my-test-ec2-keypair Would result in this effective test configuration: tests : default : template : ./template.yaml s3_bucket : my-project-s3-bucket parameters : KeyPair : my-global-ec2-keypair Notice that s3_bucket took the most specific value and KeyPair the most general. CLI interface taskcat adopts a similar cli command structure to git with a taskcat command subcommand --flag style. The cli is also designed to be simplest if run from the root of a project. Let's have a look at equivalent command to run a test: cd into the project root and type test run : cd ./quickstart-aws-vpc taskcat test run or run it from anywhere by providing the path to the project root taskcat test run -p ./quickstart-aws-vpc Non-standard credentials taskcat leverages the credential mechanisms of the AWS CLI, with the exception of environment variables. To integrate advanced credential handling (such as AWS SSO), please see issue #596 for an example Configuration files The configuration files required for taskcat have changed, to ease migration, if taskcat is run and legacy config files are found, they are converted and written to new file locations. For more information on the new format, see the config file docs . Dynamic values The example below shows an input file for a stack that requires six parameters , InstanceType , AvailablityZones , RandomString , RandomNumbers , GenerateUUID and Password Note: Value that matches the following pattern will be replaced: * All runtime injection parameters must start with $[ * Parameters must end with ] (see examples below) From: (defined in taskcat.yaml') InstanceType : t2 . small AvailablityZones : $ [ taskcat_genaz_2 ] RandomString : $ [ taskcat_random-string ] RandomNumbers : $ [ taskcat_random-numbers ] GenerateUUID : $ [ taskcat_genuuid ] Password : $ [ taskcat_genpass_8A ] PasswordConfirm : $ [ taskcat_getval_Password ] To: (At runtime passed to cloudformation API) InstanceType: t2.small AvailablityZones: us-east-1a: us-east1b RandomString: yysuawpwubvotiqgwjcu RandomNumbers: 56188163597280820763 GenerateUUID: 1c2e3483-2c99-45bb-801d-8af68a3b907b Password: tI8zN3iX8 PasswordConfirm: tI8zN3iX8 Gen Passwords More info on Passwords Generation To generate a random 8 character alpha-numeric password for testing use $[taskcat_genpass_8] as the value in the json input file * The number (8) in the injection string tells taskcat you want a password that character long. * Changing the 8 to 12 would result in a 12 character string (Optionally - you can specify the type of password by adding A or S) A alpha-numeric passwords S passwords with special characters Example: $[taskcat_genpass_8A] Generates: tI8zN3iX8 Example: $[taskcat_genpass_8S] Generates: mA5@cB5!

Purpose A primary goal of TaskCat is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in TaskCat to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. 2. Open Source Citizenship A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. 3. Expected Behavior The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members: Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Attempt collaboration before conflict. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations. 4. Unacceptable Behavior The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community: Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language. Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material. Posting or threatening to post other people\u2019s personally identifying information (\"doxing\"). Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability. Inappropriate photography or recording. Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone\u2019s consent before touching them. Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances. Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person). Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations. 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event). 6. Reporting Guidelines If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. quickstart@amazon.com. Link to reporting guidelines: codeofconduct@amazon.com Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress. 7. Addressing Grievances If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify AWS Quickstart with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. Policy 8. Scope We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues\u2013online and in-person\u2013as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business. This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members. 9.
